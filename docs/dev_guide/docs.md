# How to create and edit docs

This guide will show you how to create and edit docs in markdown format, and submit them for integration into the Donkeycar official docs.

For small changes and corrections, it's easy to use Github's built-in editor. Just click on the below button, which you'll find on the top right corner of all doc pages.

If you're already signed into Github, this will take you to the GitHub editor, where you can edit in the browser. If not, you'll have to sign into Github first. Github will automatically create a branch for your edits. 

Once you're done with your edits, go to the bottom of the page where you'll find the Commit Changes section. Enter a brief description of your changes ("fixed broken link" or "explained this part better"). The "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull reques" option will already be selected for you, and a branch name will have been assigned. Click on "Commit Changes" and we can go to the next step, the Pull Request

# What's Markdown?

Markdown is just regular unformatted text with some special characters that translate into formatting when the page is rendered in a browers. You'll find it everywhere, from Slack to Wikipedia. [here's a guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to using it. 

The main markdown you'll probably be using are:

* Links: `[text](url)`
* Images: `[text](link to image file)`
* Headings: `# Heading`
* Code: `'code here'` (use the little single quote character at the top left of your keyboard
* Bulleted lists: `Just put a * before each line of the text. Tab in front for each level of indent you want`
* Numbered lists: `Just put a 1 before each line of the text. Tab in front for each level of indent you want`
